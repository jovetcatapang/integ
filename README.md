### Digitalizing the Services of Batangas City Agriculture Office

Batangas City, a medium-sized city with consistent population growth, faces challenges in delivering services related to agriculture. The City Agriculture Office, located in Bolbok, offers various services such as renting equipment, seedlings, and tree cuttery permits. The Agri Connect Platform aims to address these issues by providing farm tractor services, financial assistance, and non-productive certification for fruit-bearing trees. The platform also includes agricultural data, farmers' information, and technology services. However, inefficiencies in service delivery, lack of a website, social media, manual data entry, and limited transportation access contribute to these issues.

The researchers plan to design, develop, and implement Agri Connect, a web app that aims to digitalize service delivery, promote collaboration among office divisions, and improve communication among service providers and users. The platform will be user-friendly, interactive, and provide basic information and support to service users.
